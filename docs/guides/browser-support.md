# Browser support

Brick declares the pinned Browserslist query
`baseline 2023 with downstream`. Its JavaScript is compiled to ES2020, and its
published CSS is built against that query with Lightning CSS.

Author component CSS with standard syntax. The package compiler owns generated
vendor prefixes required by the declared target; do not add prefixes by visual
guess. Optional effects must retain a usable baseline presentation, while
required layout, state, focus, and accessibility relationships must work at
the floor.

Portable component behavior is release-qualified in current Chromium,
Firefox, and Playwright WebKit. Mobile emulation is additional engine evidence,
not proof of physical Safari, iOS, Android, browser chrome, permissions, or
assistive technology. Those claims require the component's named platform
evidence.

An application remains responsible for its own authored code, dependencies,
build target, content, and complete journeys. Installing Brick does not make an
application compatible by itself.
