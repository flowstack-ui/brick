# Appearance and tokens

Brick ships complete light and dark semantic tokens. With no explicit setting,
the default follows `prefers-color-scheme`.

Set an appearance on the document or any subtree with the DOM contract:

```html
<html data-brick-appearance="dark">
```

```html
<section data-brick-appearance="light">
  <!-- This region uses light semantic values. -->
</section>
```

Remove the attribute to return to the system preference.

Brick also exports a typed, server-safe composition utility for local scopes:

```tsx
import { Appearance } from "@flowstack-ui/brick/appearance";

<Appearance value="dark">
  <section>Dark region</section>
</Appearance>
```

Appearance always decorates exactly one existing host without an extra
wrapper. Its existing component slot remains unchanged:

```tsx
<Appearance value="dark">
  <AppBar.Root>...</AppBar.Root>
</Appearance>
```

`value="inherit"` is the default and omits the explicit appearance attribute.
Appearance adds no background, spacing, state, persistence, toggle, or React
provider. Use Surface when the region also needs neutral paint; use Appearance
when only the semantic-token boundary is needed or when another component
already owns the visual region.

The complete stylesheet and modular `core.css` apply the active semantic
canvas, primary text color, body family, body size, and body line height to the
document body through a low-specificity foundation rule. Themes normally
change those semantic values rather than adding another body rule. Consumer
CSS in a later layer can deliberately replace the document treatment.

The optional reset stylesheet also maps native text selection to the active
accent solid/on-solid pair, with system `Highlight` colors in forced-colors mode.
This makes drag selection follow the compiled theme without requiring
application CSS.

## Custom themes

Override public semantic variables through ordinary CSS:

```css
.brand-theme {
  --brick-color-accent-solid: #5b5bd6;
  --brick-color-accent-on-solid: #ffffff;
  --brick-radius-control: 0.75rem;
}
```

```tsx
<section className="brand-theme">...</section>
```

Override foreground and background roles together, then verify contrast and
all supported states. Arbitrary consumer overrides are outside Brick's visual
accessibility guarantee.

### Complete appearance maps

A theme that supports both light and dark must assign its complete
appearance-dependent color and shadow contract at every explicit re-entry
boundary. Do not define light only at the outer theme root and assume it will
return after a dark nested scope.

```css
@layer flowstack.theme {
:where([data-flowstack-theme="ocean"]),
:where([data-flowstack-theme="ocean"][data-brick-appearance="light"]),
:where([data-flowstack-theme="ocean"] [data-brick-appearance="light"]) {
  color-scheme: light;
  /* Complete Ocean light semantic color assignments. */
}

:where([data-flowstack-theme="ocean"][data-brick-appearance="dark"]),
:where([data-flowstack-theme="ocean"] [data-brick-appearance="dark"]) {
  color-scheme: dark;
  /* Complete Ocean dark semantic color assignments. */
}
}
```

Appearance-independent typography, radius, density, and motion values may
remain on the outer theme root. Every color role claimed by an appearance must
be complete, including surfaces, text, borders, focus, interaction states,
status colors, scrim, and shadow.

Brick reserves `flowstack.theme` between its token and foundation layers. The
generated [theme contract](theme-contract.md) publishes the exact semantic and
approved component-input boundary for theme tooling.

### Portalled content

A portal rendered under `body` cannot inherit a local scope from its trigger.
Use one of two deterministic strategies.

Portal into an element inside the desired scope:

```tsx
<Dialog.Portal container={scopedLayerElement}>...</Dialog.Portal>
```

Or apply the appearance to the portalled visual roots:

```tsx
<Drawer.Portal>
  <Appearance value="dark">
    <Drawer.Overlay />
  </Appearance>
  <Appearance value="dark">
    <Drawer.Content>...</Drawer.Content>
  </Appearance>
</Drawer.Portal>
```

Brick does not inspect the trigger, copy computed CSS variables, or add a
client context. This preserves server rendering and Atom's portal ownership.

## Qualification checklist

- Test the theme's document default and every supported explicit appearance.
- Test light -> dark -> light and dark -> light -> dark nesting.
- Test hover, pressed, selected, disabled, focus, and status treatments.
- Test Drawer, Dialog, Menu, Popover, Tooltip, Select, and other portals used
  by the product.
- Test native form controls, forced colors, reduced motion, and contrast.
- If a saved preference exists, apply the document attribute before paint in
  the framework or application layer; Brick does not own persistence.

## Typography recipes

Brick exposes complete semantic typography tuples instead of asking each
component to independently choose a font size, weight, line height, and letter
spacing. Every recipe has these five variables:

```text
--brick-typography-<recipe>-font-family
--brick-typography-<recipe>-font-size
--brick-typography-<recipe>-font-weight
--brick-typography-<recipe>-line-height
--brick-typography-<recipe>-letter-spacing
```

The public recipe names are:

- authored content: `display`, `title-lg`, `title-md`, `title-sm`, `body-lg`,
  `body-md`, `body-sm`, and `caption`;
- component anatomy: `label-md`, `label-strong`, `supporting-sm`,
  `validation-sm`, `overlay-title`, `compact-title`, `compact-title-lg`,
  `surface-title-sm`, `surface-title-md`, `surface-title-lg`,
  `field-value-md`, and `field-value-lg`;
- controls: `control-xs`, `control-sm`, `control-md`, `control-lg`, and
  `control-xl`.

Component anatomy owns its semantic element and styling contract. It does not
nest `Text`; its local variables alias the same semantic recipes that `Text`
uses. Override a semantic recipe to change a role across Brick, or a documented
component variable for one component only.
