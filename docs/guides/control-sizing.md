# Control sizing

Brick uses one shared size vocabulary for controls that commonly appear in the
same row. A matching `size` should produce a shared outer rhythm rather than a
collection of unrelated component scales.

## Shared contract

| Size | Minimum block size | Control text | Typical use |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `sm` | 36px | `control-sm` | Compact application toolbars and page headers |
| `md` | 44px | `control-md` | General application controls |
| `lg` | 52px | `control-lg` | Comfortable or prominent controls |

Button, IconButton, Select, MultiSelect, Toggle, ToggleGroup, and comparable
button-like controls consume these shared geometry and control-typography
recipes. Their internal padding may differ when required by their anatomy, but
their outer height, icon scale, radius family, and baseline must align when the
same size is used.

Tabs uses the same control typography and target scale. A line tab may keep a
44px target while a nested `body-sm` label creates a deliberately quieter page
header; the target must not be reduced just to make the text look smaller.

## Editable-control exception

Input, Textarea, and editable Combobox content retain at least 16px text even
at `sm` to avoid avoidable mobile focus zoom. They still consume the shared
36/44/52px geometry and `--brick-radius-control`, so they align with adjacent
button-like controls without pretending that editable and action typography
have identical constraints.

## Composition

Use the same named size on controls that share a row. Let Stack own row gap and
alignment, and let Theme own `--brick-radius-control`, control typography, and
control height tokens. Do not repair a mismatched row with per-component
heights, transforms, margins, or literal radii.

When a control is intentionally more prominent, change its supported size and
document that hierarchy. Do not silently customize one component so that the
same size means something different.

## Verification

- Compare Button, Select, Toggle, ToggleGroup, and other button-like peers in
  one row at `sm`, `md`, and `lg`.
- Confirm matching minimum block size, vertical center, radius family, icon
  scale, and control typography.
- Confirm editable controls remain at least 16px while preserving the same
  outer geometry.
- Change the active Theme radius and typography inputs and confirm every peer
  updates together.
- Check long labels, zoom, narrow widths, RTL, focus rings, and light/dark
  appearance without introducing one-off CSS.
