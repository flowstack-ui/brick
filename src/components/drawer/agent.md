# Drawer agent guide

## Purpose

Present a finished modal side sheet while Atom owns focus, dismissal, portal, scroll-lock, and labeling behavior.

## Use when

- A temporary modal task or navigation panel should enter from a screen edge.

## Choose something else when

- The side region is persistent layout or the overlay has no edge meaning. Use Sidebar or Dialog.

## Required composition

- Compose Trigger and Portal with Overlay and Content; put a header containing Title, Description when useful, and Close inside Content, then use Stack/NavList for its body.
- Title is a native heading rather than a polymorphic layout host. Use its as prop to choose the heading level; do not pass a multi-element brand or layout through asChild. When the surface intentionally has no visible heading, give Content an explicit accessible name such as aria-label="Mobile navigation".

## Rules

- **MUST:** Use Drawer parts rather than hand-building overlay, focus trap, Escape, outside interaction, or portal behavior.
- **MUST:** Give Content an accessible name with a concise Title or, when no visible heading is appropriate, an explicit aria-label or aria-labelledby on Content.
- **MUST:** Choose size and placement from content needs: use xl when content may need the viewport but should shrink when short, and full only when the surface must always fill it.
- **MUST:** Let top and bottom Drawers grow naturally to their selected size cap; keep long overflow in Drawer.Body instead of forcing a fixed application height.
- **MUST:** Use Footer justify for simple action distribution, a Brick layout component inside Footer for complex grouping, and Button fullWidth only when the action itself should fill the row.
- **MUST:** In React Server Components, import the component subpath as import * as Drawer from @flowstack-ui/brick/drawer; use the legacy root-package runtime object only inside a client-owned module.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus drawer.css.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Building a mobile menu as an absolutely positioned div or placing Close outside the labeled content hierarchy. **Instead:** Use Drawer anatomy and compose the menu content with Brick navigation and layout components.
- **Avoid:** Adding use client to an entire Next page only to dereference the legacy Drawer runtime object. **Instead:** Use the RSC-safe module-namespace subpath so only Drawer remains client-owned.
- **Avoid:** Using asChild on Title or treating a brand lockup as a heading. **Instead:** Keep branding in the visual header and name Content explicitly when there is no concise visible title.

## Validation checklist

- Test labeling, initial focus, focus containment/return, Escape, overlay, Close, scroll lock, content growth and capped Body overflow, touch, reduced motion, narrow screens, and nested portals.
- Confirm CSS and every composed child component stylesheet are loaded.
- In a React Server Component consumer, confirm the module-namespace form passes a production prerender without promoting the page to use client.
