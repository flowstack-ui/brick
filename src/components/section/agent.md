# Section agent guide

## Purpose

Own themeable responsive block rhythm for major semantic page and application regions.

## Use when

- A thematic page or application region needs consistent large vertical rhythm beyond local component spacing.

## Choose something else when

- The need is child arrangement, inline measure, visual paint, or a complete content pattern. Use Stack/Grid, Container, Surface, or a qualified Block.

## Required composition

- Place Container inside Section for measured content; compose Surface with asChild around Section when paint must cover the Section rhythm; use Stack or Grid inside for child relationships.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Use Section's named responsive rhythm instead of repeating large page-section padding CSS.
- **MUST:** Use the default section host only for a thematic grouping, normally with a heading; select as=div when spacing alone has no sectioning meaning.
- **MUST:** Keep paint in Surface, inline measure in Container, and child arrangement in Stack or Grid rather than adding those responsibilities to Section.
- **MUST:** Choose a named recipe first; customize documented Section variables only when the theme or one deliberate region needs a value the scale cannot express.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus section.css.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Using Stack gap for page rhythm, Surface inset as section spacing, or Section as a generic div around every group. **Instead:** Assign each responsibility to Section, Surface, Container, Stack, or Grid and use as=div only when Section rhythm is useful without section semantics.

## Validation checklist

- Check named and responsive rhythm at constrained and wide widths, zoom, RTL, and vertical writing modes.
- Confirm the section has appropriate document meaning and that Surface asChild composition produces one host when full-width paint is needed.
