# ProgressCircle agent guide

## Purpose

Present compact circular read-only task progress with Brick-owned SVG ring geometry while Atom Progress owns progressbar semantics, normalized range state, and determinate or indeterminate behavior.

## Use when

- Ongoing measurable or indeterminate work needs compact circular feedback in a card, toolbar, dialog, or other bounded region.

## Choose something else when

- Linear space communicates change more clearly, the value is a stable measurement or user input, stages matter, or the finished layout is loading. Use Progress, the native meter element, Slider, Steps, or Skeleton.

## Required composition

- Give ProgressCircle.Root a concise Label or native accessible name, pass a measurable value or null/omit it for indeterminate work, then compose one Circle with Brick-owned Track before Indicator. Add optional Value and Label outside Circle.
- Choose size, thickness, cap, and tone on Root. Keep SVG geometry decorative, preserve clockwise motion independent of RTL, and keep application aria-busy state and announcements outside ProgressCircle.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Give Root an accessible task name through Label or native ARIA; Circle, Track, Indicator, and visible Value are decorative or silent and do not replace that name.
- **MUST:** Use a numeric value only for measurable work, pass null or omit it for indeterminate work, and preserve Atom's truthful min/max normalization, clamping, state, and aria-valuenow behavior.
- **MUST:** Treat Circle, Track, and Indicator as Brick-owned fixed SVG presentation over Atom Progress context; keep one Circle, order Track before Indicator, and do not override viewBox, radius, circumference, dash array, or dash offset.
- **MUST:** Keep Root as the only progressbar and announcement path, keep SVG anatomy aria-hidden and unfocusable, and do not make circular progress keyboard adjustable or use it for static measurement.
- **SHOULD:** Localize optional visible Value and provide aria-valuetext when the numeric range needs domain wording; do not assume the decorative Value changes Root's accessible value text.
- **MUST:** Keep the ring square, contained within its surrounding region, clockwise in LTR and RTL, label wrapping intact, track visible, and reduced-motion indeterminate state understandable as a static arc.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus progress-circle.css.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Using an unlabeled decorative spinner, adding progressbar semantics to SVG, passing zero for unknown work, or reversing the ring in RTL. **Instead:** Name Atom-backed Root, use indeterminate null state, keep Brick SVG silent, and retain clockwise geometry.
- **Avoid:** Overriding component-owned SVG radius or dash geometry or using ProgressCircle for capacity or input. **Instead:** Use public size/thickness/cap/tone recipes and choose native meter or Slider for other semantic jobs.

## Validation checklist

- Verify Root naming, determinate loading/complete and indeterminate state, aria-valuenow presence/absence, clamping, invalid-range normalization, custom value text, localized visible Value, and Atom state propagation.
- Verify one Root progressbar, one decorative Circle, Track before Indicator, fixed component-owned geometry, silent/unfocusable SVG, no keyboard interaction, native props, refs, and supported composition.
- Verify five sizes, three thicknesses, both caps, all tones, square containment, long labels, zoom, clockwise LTR/RTL behavior, track contrast, light/dark appearance, forced colors, and reduced motion.
