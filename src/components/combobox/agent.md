# Combobox agent guide

## Purpose

Present finished editable filtering and single-value selection while Atom owns committed value, input text, open state, listbox focus, positioning, dismissal, validation, and form participation.

## Use when

- A predefined option set benefits from editable filtering, including search-and-navigate interfaces whose selected result triggers an application-owned effect.

## Choose something else when

- Any text is valid without options, one predefined value needs no filtering, several values must be selected, or the popup contains commands. Use Input, Select or RadioGroup, MultiSelect, or DropdownMenu.

## Required composition

- Compose a persistent Field.Label, then Combobox.Root with the complete options -> Combobox.Control with Input and optional Clear and Trigger -> optional Portal -> Content -> Listbox -> one Item per available option, plus Empty, Loading, groups, and labels when required.
- Keep committed value, inputValue, and open as independent state axes. Keep rendered Items aligned with Root options and put noninteractive complete labels inside each Item.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Keep committed value, editable input text, and popup open state independent and pair each controlled prop with its matching callback.
- **MUST:** Keep Root options, rendered Items, stable values, labels, disabled state, grouping, and custom filtering aligned as one authoritative collection.
- **MUST:** Keep Input as the named editable combobox focus owner, Content as positioning and dismissal owner, and Listbox as semantic option owner; never hand-position a Surface or put listbox role on Content.
- **MUST:** Preserve active-descendant focus, Arrow/Home/End, Enter, Escape close-then-clear, Tab, openOnFocus, pointer selection, disabled skipping, required committed-value validity, named hidden submission, external form, and reset.
- **MUST:** Enable freeSolo only when values outside the predefined collection are valid; display text alone must not satisfy required validity for a closed vocabulary.
- **MUST:** Keep routing, remote loading, analytics, persistence, and destination policy in application callbacks while Empty and Loading accurately reflect the current collection state.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus combobox.css and Field CSS when composed.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Conflating input text with committed value, enabling freeSolo for closed vocabulary, omitting rendered Items, or putting listbox role on Content. **Instead:** Manage all three states, restrict freeSolo, align options with Items, and preserve Atom's compound semantic owners.
- **Avoid:** Putting Link, Button, or other controls inside Item or closing a hand-positioned result Surface with custom document listeners. **Instead:** Use noninteractive option labels and perform the selected value's application effect from onValueChange inside the complete Combobox popup anatomy.

## Validation checklist

- Verify controlled and uncontrolled committed value, input text, and open state; default label initialization; filtering and grouping; disabled options; typing; Arrow/Home/End; Enter option and freeSolo commits; Escape; Tab; openOnFocus; Empty; Loading; Clear; Trigger; pointer selection; and clearOnSelect.
- Verify visible Field naming, required committed-value validity, inline/native validation focus, hidden named value, external form, reset, Control-sized collision positioning, Portal, outside dismissal and cancellation, and highlighted-item scrolling.
- Verify recipes and sizes, long labels, narrow widths, zoom, RTL, mobile focus, light and dark appearance, forced colors, and application-owned search-and-navigate effects.
