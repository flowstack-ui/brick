# Stack agent guide

## Purpose

Arrange children on one primary axis with responsive direction, tokenized spacing, alignment, wrapping, and explicit child sizing.

## Use when

- Content needs one-dimensional vertical or horizontal layout.

## Choose something else when

- Both rows and columns need explicit track control. Use Grid.
- Content overlaps in depth. Use ZStack or Surface media anatomy.

## Required composition

- Choose VStack when the axis is always vertical, HStack when it is always horizontal, and Stack when the same content changes axis at a breakpoint.
- Use as="ul" or as="ol" when the one-dimensional peers form a semantic list; Stack removes native list geometry while preserving the relationship.
- Use Stack.Item when one direct child must remain content-sized, fixed, or consume a proportional share.
- When the parent changes axis, review each Item flex recipe too; a proportional desktop column usually becomes content-sized in a mobile column.
- Keep the Item wrapper when equal outer tracks contain children with different padding or borders; use asChild only when the child's own box should participate in flex allocation.
- When Stack.Item composes a control with asChild, rely on the control's own size recipe; Stack preserves its declared minimum block size while adding flex participation.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Use Stack for one primary layout axis and allow wrapping only when the resulting order remains clear.
- **MUST:** Use non-negative numeric spacing factors for ordinary gap and logical edge spacing; use an explicit CSS value only for a measured exception or application spacing token, and preserve legacy string tokens when maintaining existing geometry.
- **MUST:** Use a semantic list host when Stack children form a real set; do not add consumer CSS to cancel native ul or ol margins or markers because Stack owns that host geometry.
- **MUST:** Use responsive Stack values for arrangement changes; use Show/Hide only when the actual interface changes.
- **MUST:** Preserve reading and focus order; do not simulate reverse direction or visual ordering.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus stack.css.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Duplicating the same content through Show/Hide only to switch row and column. **Instead:** Use responsive Stack direction.
- **Avoid:** Writing grow/shrink CSS for ordinary columns. **Instead:** Use Stack.Item flex recipes.
- **Avoid:** Adding a local class only because the desired gap is outside the legacy zero-through-six token scale. **Instead:** Use a numeric factor such as gap={8}, an explicit CSS length, or an application custom property through the supported spacing prop.

## Validation checklist

- Check source and visual order at narrow widths and zoom.
- Confirm numeric, explicit, and responsive spacing values create the intended computed geometry; reject negative, non-finite, and empty values.
- For ul and ol hosts, confirm zero native margin, no visual marker, and preserved list semantics.
- Check every authored breakpoint, logical edge spacing, wrapping, alignment, and RTL behavior.
