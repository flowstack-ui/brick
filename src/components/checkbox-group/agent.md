# Checkbox Group agent guide

## Purpose

Coordinate related multi-selection with structured item labels, optional descriptions, native repeated form values, and an optional aggregate parent control.

## Use when

- Several independently selectable choices belong to one named group or need a select-all parent.

## Choose something else when

- The choice is independent and does not share group state. Use Checkbox.
- Exactly one option must be selected. Use Radio Group or Select.
- The interface needs remote option loading, search, or a generated filter engine. Use Combobox or application-owned discovery controls.

## Required composition

- Give Root an accessible group name directly or compose it inside Fieldset with one visible Legend and shared description or error.
- Compose Root with Item children; wrap each primary label in ItemLabel and supporting text in ItemDescription when structured item relationships are needed.
- Use Parent only with an explicit allValues list containing the currently selectable declared values; omit individually disabled values and never infer the collection from rendered children.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Use Checkbox Group only for related multi-selection; keep one-of-many choice, independent consent, remote search, and application filter execution in their owning patterns.
- **MUST:** Give Root a persistent accessible group name and every Item a complete visible associated label; placeholder or surrounding layout does not name the group.
- **MUST:** Give every Item a unique stable string value and let the application own persistence, query synchronization, result counts, and filtering side effects.
- **MUST:** Supply Parent allValues explicitly from the selectable declared set and do not include disabled choices or derive the set from DOM children.
- **MUST:** Use the vertical default for scan-heavy groups and horizontal only when wrapped reading order remains clear under narrow widths, zoom, and localization.
- **MUST:** Keep required or invalid messaging at group scope when any eligible option can satisfy the requirement; do not paint every Item as individually invalid.
- **MUST:** Preserve disabled and read-only Items, one-or-more required validity, first-enabled validation focus, Fieldset relationships, named repeated-value submission, external form association, and uncontrolled reset.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus checkbox-group.css and any Fieldset styles used.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Building a filter facet with unrelated standalone checkboxes and no group name. **Instead:** Use one named CheckboxGroup.Root with stable Item values and keep query execution in the application.
- **Avoid:** Using Parent without an explicit current selectable set. **Instead:** Pass allValues deliberately so none, mixed, and all state remain deterministic.
- **Avoid:** Adding custom row hover or focus paint around labels. **Instead:** Keep the full row clickable while Brick confines visual interaction feedback to the checkbox square.

## Validation checklist

- Inspect the group name, item labels and descriptions, unique values, repeated native form entries, required validity, reset, and disabled or read-only behavior.
- Toggle Items and Parent with keyboard, pointer, and touch; verify none, mixed, and all states against the exact declared allValues set.
- Check vertical and horizontal wrapping, long localized labels, 320 CSS pixels, 200% text, 400% zoom, RTL, dark appearance, and forced colors.
- Confirm application-owned filtering, persistence, URL state, counts, and asynchronous results remain outside Checkbox Group.
