# DropdownMenu agent guide

## Purpose

Present a finished compact command or settings menu from a visible button while Atom owns menu semantics, real item focus, keyboard navigation, selection, dismissal, portals, and collision-aware placement.

## Use when

- A visible named button should reveal a short list of commands, independent settings, exclusive settings, secondary destinations, or nested commands.

## Choose something else when

- Commands belong to a contextual gesture, several persistent application command categories, a form value, or ordinary site navigation. Use ContextMenu, Menubar, Select, or NavigationMenu or NavList.

## Required composition

- Compose DropdownMenu.Root with DropdownMenu.Trigger asChild around a finished named Button or IconButton, plus DropdownMenu.Portal and DropdownMenu.Content. Build Content from uniquely valued Item, CheckboxItem, RadioGroup and RadioItem, Group and Label, Separator, and paired Sub, SubTrigger, and SubContent parts; use Leading, ItemLabel, Description, Shortcut, and ItemIndicator for finished rows.
- For a genuine secondary destination, compose Item asChild around one Brick Link and preserve its href; command rows use onSelect. Reproduce any local Appearance scope on portalled Content and SubContent.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Use DropdownMenu for commands or settings opened by a visible button; use Select for a form value, ContextMenu for contextual invocation, Menubar for persistent command categories, and navigation owners for route lists.
- **MUST:** Compose Trigger around a visible finished Button or IconButton with a complete accessible name and preserve Atom's button, popup, expanded, controls, disabled, and input-aware opening semantics.
- **MUST:** Use uniquely valued Item, CheckboxItem, and RadioItem for their matching roles, provide textValue when rendered children are not searchable text, and preserve real focus, typeahead, and disabled-item navigation without activation.
- **MUST:** Choose closeOnSelect by job: commands normally close while checkbox and radio settings normally remain open; do not close the tree with competing handlers or document listeners.
- **MUST:** Keep SubTrigger and SubContent inside one Sub and preserve direction-aware cascade keys, hover intent, whole-tree dismissal, and collision-resolved placement instead of inventing responsive drill-in behavior.
- **MUST:** Compose a genuine destination Item around one Brick Link so href and menuitem semantics share the same interactive owner; do not attach routing to a command-only div.
- **MUST:** Use Leading, ItemLabel, Description, Shortcut, ItemIndicator, and tone=danger for their documented jobs instead of rebuilding columns, selection glyphs, icon sizing, or destructive emphasis.
- **SHOULD:** Let Content use its collision-aware available height and native internal scrolling; verify three densities, long labels, zoom, narrow viewports, LTR and RTL, and reachable nested commands without semantic transformation.
- **MUST:** When Portal leaves a local Appearance scope, reproduce that scope on Content and SubContent or target a portal container inside it.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus dropdown-menu.css and every composed child component stylesheet.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Using an unlabeled icon trigger, Popover for menu commands, DropdownMenu for form selection or primary navigation, or custom key and document dismissal handlers. **Instead:** Use a named Button or IconButton, choose the semantic owner, and rely on DropdownMenu and shared Menu behavior.
- **Avoid:** Nesting a Button inside Item, rebuilding row columns, or treating Shortcut text as registered keyboard behavior. **Instead:** Keep one interactive owner, compose the public row anatomy, and register application shortcuts outside DropdownMenu.

## Validation checklist

- Verify Trigger name and semantics, click, tap, Enter, Space, ArrowDown, and ArrowUp opening, initial real item focus, Home/End, typeahead, controlled and disabled state, Tab exit, Escape, outside dismissal, and focus return.
- Verify command, destination-link, checkbox mixed, radio, group, indicator, separator, and submenu behavior; unique values and textValue; close policies; modal and parent-modal ownership; and LTR and RTL cascade keys.
- Verify three densities, Leading geometry, danger meaning, constrained scrolling, collision placement, zoom, narrow viewports, reduced motion, forced colors, light and dark portalled appearance, and complete CSS.
