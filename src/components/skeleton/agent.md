# Skeleton agent guide

## Purpose

Preserve expected content geometry during a short application-owned load without exposing placeholder content as meaningful UI.

## Use when

- The final geometry is known and a short loading operation would otherwise cause disruptive layout shift.

## Choose something else when

- Progress duration is known, the operation failed, or the layout is not yet predictable. Use Progress, an error recovery state, or a stable generic loading message according to the state.

## Required composition

- Match each Skeleton shape and dimension to the expected final content, mark the owning region busy, and keep any required application status copy outside the aria-hidden placeholder.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Use supported shape, line, width, and height inputs to preserve the expected final geometry rather than decorating an arbitrary empty region.
- **MUST:** Mark the owning region aria-busy while loading; Skeleton is aria-hidden and is not a status or live region.
- **MUST:** Do not place fake names, notifications, controls, or other meaningful placeholder content in the accessibility tree.
- **MUST:** Keep the contextual default paint or another semantic Theme role visibly distinct from the actual containing surface in light and dark appearance.
- **MUST:** Preserve reduced-motion and forced-colors behavior and avoid application animation overrides.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus skeleton.css.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Using Skeleton as generic decoration or relying on its animation as the only loading announcement. **Instead:** Use Skeleton only for known geometry, mark the owning region busy, and provide application-owned status text only when an announcement is actually required.
- **Avoid:** Selecting a semantic surface token that resolves to the same paint as the containing overlay in one appearance. **Instead:** Keep the contextual primary-text tint or verify any semantic override against every containing surface in both appearances.

## Validation checklist

- Check stable geometry before and after load, aria-hidden placeholder output, owning-region busy state, and absence of focusable fake content.
- Check placeholder visibility on base, raised, and overlay surfaces across light/dark appearance, narrow widths, zoom, increased text size, reduced motion, and forced colors.
