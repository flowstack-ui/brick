# Data Grid agent guide

## Purpose

Present flat interactive tabular data with Atom-owned active-cell navigation and optional row selection while applications own data, sorting, filtering, and pagination.

## Use when

- People must navigate tabular cells with arrow keys, select rows, or activate sortable column headers.

## Choose something else when

- People only need to read and compare static row-and-column data. Use Table.
- The content is a visual card collection or ordinary two-dimensional page layout. Use Grid, List, or Card composition.
- Cells must contain independent controls, support editing, resize or pin columns, virtualize rows, or expose a schema-driven enterprise data engine. Use An application-owned data tool or a separately qualified future component.

## Required composition

- Compose explicit Container when wide content needs horizontal overflow, then Root with Caption or another stable accessible name, Header, Body, optional Footer, indexed Rows, indexed ColumnHeaders, and Cells.
- Keep all row and column indexes one-based and provide truthful logical rowCount and columnCount, including when only one page or window is rendered.
- Place external Toolbar, filtering controls, result count, and Pagination around the grid; Data Grid never creates or executes those systems.
- For application-controlled sorting, give the ColumnHeader onAction, update the data and sortDirection outside Data Grid, and keep SortIndicator decorative.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Choose Data Grid only when composite keyboard navigation, row selection, or sortable-header activation has real value; use Table for static comparison.
- **MUST:** Provide one stable accessible name, one-based row and column indexes, and truthful logical counts for the complete represented data set.
- **MUST:** Keep data transformation, filtering, sorting direction changes, fetching, caching, URL state, pagination, stale-request cancellation, and persistence in the application.
- **MUST:** Compose independently named Brick controls and Pagination outside Root; do not place arbitrary interactive controls inside v1 cells or make the grid itself own surrounding workflow state.
- **MUST:** Author DataGrid.Container explicitly when honest columns need horizontal overflow; Root never inserts containment and narrow layouts must preserve the tabular relationships.
- **MUST:** Let the outline Root own its border, radius, and exposed cell corners; do not add a second framed or clipping wrapper to repair the outline recipe.
- **MUST:** Use stable row IDs as selection values, keep active cell and row selection as independent states, and do not derive identity from the current visual index.
- **MUST:** Give an actionable sortable ColumnHeader pointer and Enter parity, expose sortDirection only on the active sorted header, and treat SortIndicator as decorative.
- **MUST:** If an application windows rows, preserve full logical one-based indexes and totals and keep the active cell mounted or move active state before it leaves the DOM; geometry utilities do not own grid semantics or focus.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus data-grid.css.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Using Data Grid because a static table has many rows. **Instead:** Use Table until arrow-key cell navigation, row selection, or sortable-header activation is a genuine task requirement.
- **Avoid:** Putting search, filters, pagination, fetches, and data mutation inside Data Grid. **Instead:** Compose those application-owned systems around the public Data Grid anatomy.
- **Avoid:** Placing buttons, links, editable fields, or menus in v1 cells without an interaction mode. **Instead:** Keep cells non-editing and use an application-owned data tool when independent cell controls are required.
- **Avoid:** Using zero-based or page-local indexes while claiming a larger logical set. **Instead:** Pass one-based logical indexes and truthful counts so active-descendant announcements remain coherent.
- **Avoid:** Wrapping an outline Data Grid in another bordered or rounded clipping surface to hide sharp cell corners. **Instead:** Keep Container responsible only for overflow and let the outline Root own one complete rounded boundary.

## Validation checklist

- Inspect the accessible name, roles, one-based indexes, logical counts, active descendant, selection metadata, disabled/read-only states, and sort direction.
- Test one Tab entry, arrows, Home and End, PageUp and PageDown, Ctrl or Meta plus Home and End, RTL mapping, disabled skipping, and pointer or Enter sortable-header parity.
- Verify stable selection IDs and focus after application sorting, filtering, page changes, or reordered data.
- Check explicit Container overflow, complete outline corners with and without Header or Footer, 320 CSS pixels, 200% text, 400% zoom, long content, dark appearance, forced colors, and no page-level horizontal overflow.
- Confirm editing, arbitrary cell controls, virtualization, schemas, fetching, filtering, pagination, and persistence remain excluded.
