# Table agent guide

## Purpose

Present finished static row-and-column relationships with native table semantics while Atom owns the semantic parts and sort metadata.

## Use when

- People need to compare values across meaningful columns in pricing, reports, invoices, inventories, audit results, or compact summaries.

## Choose something else when

- The region needs arrow-key cell navigation, row selection, editing, resizing, or another interactive composite model. Use Data Grid or an application-owned data tool.
- The content is a sequence without meaningful column relationships or a label/value definition structure. Use List, Grid, Stack, or a semantic definition-list composition.
- The narrow layout must convert rows into unrelated cards and no longer preserves column comparison. Use An application-owned alternate view with an explicit responsive policy.

## Required composition

- Compose optional Container > Root > Caption, Header, Body, and optional Footer; place Row inside each section and Head or Cell inside Row according to native table content rules.
- Use Head with scope="row" for body row labels and keep the default column scope for header cells; use id and headers for complex associations.
- Author Container explicitly when honest comparison needs horizontal overflow, and set the public minimum-inline-size token to the smallest width that preserves the column relationships.
- When Table moves vertically, put the visible border and radius on the stable labelled Scroll Area viewport, use Table variant=line inside it, and keep persistent naming outside the moving viewport with aria-labelledby.
- Put an independently named Button and optional decorative SortIndicator inside the active Head when the application owns sorting.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Preserve native table anatomy and meaningful row and column headers; do not rebuild tabular comparison with generic Grid, Stack, div, or ARIA role substitutes.
- **MUST:** Keep Table static and readable; do not add row focus, whole-row activation, selection, arrow-key cell navigation, data mapping, filtering, pagination, editing, or virtualization to Table.
- **MUST:** Author Table.Container or a separately labelled Scroll Area when wide comparison needs overflow; Root never inserts a wrapper and Table never hides columns or converts them into cards.
- **MUST:** At narrow widths, preserve header-to-cell relationships, complete material values, and an understandable comparison path rather than merely stacking unrelated plan or record cards.
- **MUST:** For bounded vertical scrolling, let the stable Scroll Area viewport own the visible border and radius; do not use a moving Table outline as the scroll-frame boundary.
- **MUST:** Let the application sort data and pass sortDirection only to the active header; SortIndicator is decorative and never supplies the control, name, or behavior.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus table.css.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Using generic layout components for a pricing matrix because custom positioning feels easier. **Instead:** Use Table's native Head and Cell relationships, then customize the closed recipes and public Table variables for the product-specific comparison.
- **Avoid:** Hiding material columns on mobile or visually cloning labels into card rows. **Instead:** Contain honest horizontal overflow or provide a separately authored application view; do not destroy or fake the native column relationships.
- **Avoid:** Making rows hoverable or clickable without a complete interaction owner. **Instead:** Keep rows structural and place independently named Brick links or buttons inside the appropriate cells.
- **Avoid:** Using Table variant=outline as the visible frame inside a vertically scrolling viewport. **Instead:** Paint the stable Scroll Area viewport with Surface, use Table variant=line inside it, and connect a persistent external label with aria-labelledby.
- **Avoid:** Using a visible recommendation color as the only explanation for a preferred pricing column. **Instead:** Keep the plan label and recommendation reason readable in ordinary text, then use Table paint only as supporting emphasis.

## Validation checklist

- Check caption or surrounding naming, header scope, cell associations, source order, plan or record labels, and independently named controls.
- Check Container overflow, the authored minimum comparison width, stable viewport corners during vertical scrolling, sticky header boundaries when used, 320 CSS pixels, zoom, long content, RTL, and no page-level horizontal overflow.
- Check light and dark themes, forced colors, row and column boundaries, recommendation meaning without color, focus visibility for interactive descendants, and CSS delivery.
- Check that sorting, selection, filtering, pagination, data services, and responsive alternate-view policy remain application owned.
