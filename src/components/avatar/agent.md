# Avatar agent guide

## Purpose

Present one compact person or entity identity with a finished fixed-square image/fallback recipe and optional visual status ring.

## Use when

- A person, organization, workspace, or other named entity needs a compact fixed-square identity token with explicit fallback content.

## Choose something else when

- A larger editorial or profile portrait needs an authored aspect ratio, crop, focal position, or responsive measure. Use Image.
- A count or dot must attach to an identity. Use NotificationBadge composed around Avatar.

## Required composition

- Provide explicit alt and fallback; keep Avatar passive and let an owning Button or Link provide interaction, focus, and the functional accessible name.
- Keep visible identity or status text nearby when the image or status ring alone would be ambiguous or consequential.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Use Avatar for compact fixed-square identity presentation, not generic media or larger editorial portraits.
- **MUST:** Decide alt from context: preserve meaningful identity when Avatar adds it, and use alt="" only when adjacent text or the owning control already supplies the same identity.
- **MUST:** Pass the same source to the Atom-backed Root and Image path, preserve idle/loading/loaded/error state, and keep explicit fallback content durable through missing, changed, delayed, and failed images.
- **MUST:** Supply explicit localized fallback content; do not generate initials or infer identity from a filename.
- **MUST:** Keep Avatar passive; wrap it with the public Button or Link that owns any action or destination.
- **MUST:** Provide separate accessible status text when a status ring communicates meaningful availability.
- **MUST:** Choose the nearest named Avatar size, including 2xl through 5xl for larger square profile identities, instead of overriding --brick-avatar-size inline; use Image for authored non-square portrait media.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus avatar.css.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Forcing a large 4:5 profile portrait into Avatar, using alt="" merely because a name appears somewhere nearby, generating fallback initials inside Brick, or treating the status ring as an announcement. **Instead:** Use Image for authored portrait media, make the alt decision from the specific context, provide explicit fallback content, and keep meaningful status in text.

## Validation checklist

- Check missing, idle, loading, loaded, changed-source, and error paths; delayed fallback timing; fixed square size; crop; informative and decorative naming; passive semantics; nearby identity/status text; light/dark/forced colors; zoom; and RTL.
- Confirm a named Avatar size is used, CSS is loaded, and any owning Button, Link, or NotificationBadge preserves its own public contract.
