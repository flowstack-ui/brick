# Slider agent guide

## Purpose

Provide a styled approximate numeric single-value or range input while Atom owns pointer, touch, keyboard, form, and field behavior.

## Use when

- A person chooses an approximate value or bounded range and direct manipulation is more useful than exact text entry.

## Choose something else when

- Exact numeric entry, a small named choice set, or read-only completion is the real job. Use NumberInput, Select, or Progress.

## Required composition

- Compose Root > Track > Range plus one indexed Thumb for every value; place optional Marker parts in Track and optional ValueLabel inside its Thumb.
- Use Slider as the sole control in one Field when a visible label, description, error, or required state is needed; otherwise name every standalone Thumb explicitly.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Render one indexed Thumb for every value and keep Marker inside Track and ValueLabel inside the owning Thumb.
- **MUST:** Use Slider only when approximate direct manipulation is appropriate; use NumberInput or Select when exact or named choices matter.
- **MUST:** Provide one visible Field label for the complete Slider or a complete accessible name for every standalone Thumb.
- **SHOULD:** Use an external application-owned output when dense ranges or long localized values would collide with a thumb ValueLabel.
- **MUST:** Use onValueChange for live updates and onValueCommit for completed interactions; true pointer cancellation restores the pointer-down value without commit while lost capture commits the latest value.
- **MUST:** Preserve one active pointer session, non-slider-axis page scrolling, orientation-aware keys, and horizontal LTR and RTL pointer and Arrow behavior.
- **SHOULD:** Keep the default Track inset when a parent clips overflow; set the public Track-inset token to zero only when the surrounding composition preserves complete endpoint target and focus paint.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus slider.css.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Rendering a range with one Thumb, treating decorative markers as labels, or using Slider for a discrete named choice without explaining the values. **Instead:** Match Thumbs to values, label the actual control, and choose Select or RadioGroup when names carry the meaning.

## Validation checklist

- Check pointer, touch, keyboard, large steps, range bounds, controlled values, reset, disabled, read-only, invalid, and form submission.
- Check horizontal and vertical orientation, RTL, narrow containment, complete 44px endpoint targets, any customized Track inset, zoom, reduced motion, forced colors, and label readability.
