# OTPField agent guide

## Purpose

Present one short verification, recovery, or pairing code as finished segmented entry while Atom owns filtering, paste distribution, roving focus, completion, validation, reset, and combined-value submission.

## Use when

- A person enters or pastes a short one-time code supplied through another channel into visually separated cells.

## Choose something else when

- The value is a reusable password, permanent PIN, numeric quantity, arbitrary identifier, or ordinary variable-length text. Use PasswordToggleField, NumberInput, or Input according to the actual entry job.

## Required composition

- Compose one visibly labelled Field with OTPField.Root, then render exactly one OTPField.Input for each normalized length position in stable logical source order. Add aria-hidden Separator only for deliberate visual grouping; layout wrappers may group cells without creating separate values.
- Give Root one accessible group name, character type, length, and submission name. Localize getInputLabel for every position and treat autoSubmit and autoFocus as explicit application workflow decisions.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Treat all cells as one logical code, match visible Input count and order to Root length, and never create independent application state, validation, or submission names for each cell.
- **MUST:** Choose numeric, alphabetic, alphanumeric, or a safe custom pattern that accepts exactly the intended characters and preserve the same filtering for typing and paste.
- **MUST:** Name Root through Field or native ARIA, localize every generated position label, keep Separator decorative, and do not add unsupported aria-required to role=group.
- **MUST:** Preserve one roving Tab stop, render-order registration, replacement and advance, Arrow/Home/End, Backspace/Delete, complete-code paste, disabled/read-only state, and logical source order in RTL.
- **MUST:** Enable autoSubmit only when a complete accepted code should intentionally submit the associated form, with application-owned pending, verification, error, retry, and focus recovery behavior; choose autoFocus just as deliberately.
- **MUST:** Keep required validity on the first visible cell and Root's named combined value submission-only, including Field invalid mirroring, external form association, and uncontrolled reset.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus otp-field.css and Field CSS when composed.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Building unrelated character inputs, rendering a different cell count than length, blocking paste, reversing cells in RTL, leaving generated labels unlocalized, or auto-submitting by habit. **Instead:** Use one named OTPField value, align cells to length and logical order, preserve Atom entry behavior, localize labels, and make submission an explicit application decision.
- **Avoid:** Putting code delivery, expiry, resend, attempt limits, rate limiting, or verification inside the component. **Instead:** Keep security and workflow policy in the application or service and let OTPField report value and completion only.

## Validation checklist

- Verify controlled and uncontrolled full value, length, render-order and explicit indices, all filters, typing replacement, accepted paste distribution, Backspace/Delete, Arrow/Home/End, one roving Tab stop, deliberate autoFocus, mask display, disabled/read-only behavior, and localized cell labels.
- Verify onComplete timing, intentional autoSubmit, Root and Field naming/descriptions, required validity on the first cell, invalid state across cells, inline/native validation focus, combined named value, external form, reset, separators, native props, render composition, and refs.
- Verify deliberate wrapping and grouping, 320 CSS pixels, 200% text, 400% zoom, RTL logical order, touch targets, long localized labels, focus visibility, forced colors, and every supported appearance.
