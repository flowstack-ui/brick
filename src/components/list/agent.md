# List agent guide

## Purpose

Render finished ordered or unordered content with native list semantics, optional structured rows, markers, density, and boundaries.

## Use when

- Content is naturally a set of peer items or a sequence and needs Brick's finished list presentation.

## Choose something else when

- Rows are persistent route destinations or need current-route state. Use NavList.
- Rows form a keyboard-operated choice, action collection, data table, or two-dimensional grid. Use Listbox, Menu, Table, or DataGrid according to the interaction.
- Content only needs visual spacing and has no list relationship. Use Stack or Grid.

## Required composition

- Compose Root > Item; for structured rows use Leading, Content with Title and Description, then Trailing in that order.
- Use ordered only when sequence changes meaning and preserve native list hosts when composing with asChild or render.
- Keep Trailing for compact metadata or controls; when a long action would narrow supporting copy, place the action with the title inside Content using Brick layout instead.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Use List only for a real item or sequence relationship and preserve native list semantics.
- **MUST:** Keep structured row parts in Leading, Content, Trailing order and use one Content and one Trailing maximum per Item.
- **MUST:** Keep Trailing compact; move long actions into a Content-owned layout when a fixed trailing column would damage narrow-screen reading.
- **MUST:** Do not add row selection, activation, focus movement, or navigation behavior to List; choose the component that owns that interaction.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus list.css.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Using List as a generic row layout, making an Item itself clickable, or placing a long action in Trailing until supporting text becomes a narrow column. **Instead:** Use Stack or Grid for non-list layout, NavList or another interaction owner for clickable rows, and move long actions into Content's own layout.
- **Avoid:** Assuming an Item's disabled presentation disables controls inside it. **Instead:** Apply the proper disabled contract to every interactive descendant; List's disabled state is descriptive and visual only.

## Validation checklist

- Inspect ul or ol and li output, ordered meaning, marker behavior, structured-part order, nesting, roles, and CSS delivery.
- Test long titles and descriptions, compact and comfortable density, all variants and markers, first-line marker alignment in bordered simple and structured rows, 320 CSS px, 200 and 400 percent zoom, RTL, and forced colors.
- Confirm Trailing content does not squeeze Content, controls have names and touch targets, disabled descendants are handled explicitly, and List adds no keyboard model.
