# Link Box agent guide

## Purpose

Expand one real destination across a containing region while keeping secondary controls independent.

## Use when

- A card, result, article, or other bounded item has one primary destination and needs a larger pointer target.
- The same item may contain a separate save, compare, menu, or other action.

## Choose something else when

- The complete region performs an operation instead of navigating. Use Button or Pressable.
- Only the visible text should be clickable or pointer text selection is important. Use Link.

## Required composition

- Wrap the complete visual item in LinkBox.Root and put LinkBox.Link around concise destination text, usually the item title.
- Wrap every independently interactive sibling in LinkBox.Action; never place buttons or additional links inside LinkBox.Link.
- When an Action overlays media through ZStack, compose ZStack.Item asChild with LinkBox.Action and use ZStack.Root isolation="open" plus ZStack.Item layer="action"; use edgeSpacing when the control needs a theme-space inset.
- Give Root the semantic host for the item, such as article or li, and keep the inner Card.Root as its default div to avoid duplicate semantic containers.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Provide exactly one primary LinkBox.Link with a real destination and concise accessible name.
- **MUST:** Keep secondary controls outside the primary anchor and inside LinkBox.Action.
- **MUST:** For an Action nested in a ZStack overlay, use ZStack's public isolation and named-layer API, then prove the independent action and expanded link both activate correctly in a real browser.
- **MUST:** Do not add role, tabIndex, click handlers, or Pressable behavior to LinkBox.Root.
- **MUST:** Load styles.css or core.css plus link-box.css; the modular entry includes Link styling.
- **SHOULD:** Use Root variant plain for an unbounded editorial preview whose edge media and unpadded copy should not receive a hover boundary; focus-visible remains intact.

## Common mistakes

- **Avoid:** Wrapping the entire Card in Link and then adding favorite or menu buttons inside it. **Instead:** Use LinkBox.Root, keep one title LinkBox.Link, and layer each separate control through LinkBox.Action.
- **Avoid:** Making Root focusable in addition to Link. **Instead:** Root is only a visual containing region; the real Link owns focus and navigation.
- **Avoid:** Placing LinkBox.Action inside an isolated overlay layout without checking stacking contexts. **Instead:** Merge ZStack.Item onto LinkBox.Action with asChild, set ZStack.Root isolation="open", set the item layer="action", and verify pointer activation rather than recreating the relationship with inline styles.
- **Avoid:** Using LinkBox for a card that only performs an operation. **Instead:** Use Button or Pressable so action semantics and keyboard behavior remain truthful.

## Validation checklist

- Inspect the final DOM for one primary a[href] and no nested interactive elements.
- Click empty visual areas, then keyboard-focus and activate the named link with Enter.
- Verify secondary controls activate independently with both pointer and keyboard input and do not navigate.
- Check the whole-region hover and focus ring in light, dark, forced colors, narrow layouts, and zoom.
